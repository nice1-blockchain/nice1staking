Introduction: **Offer Rewards to your users for staking!** (Tokens and NFT's)

Powered by Nice1 

# Use cases
You have a collection of NFT's and you are thinking of launching a token? reward the holders of your NFT, offering an equal distribution to all of them in exchange for blocking their NFT for X amount of time.

Or you have your own token and you want to launch a new collection of NFT's for your community members.  

The limit is set by you.

## How it works

With these 2 contracts you will be able to offer staking campaigns to your users and offer both NFT's and tokens as rewards.

*The 2 versions work independently:*

**n1nfttotoken:** In this version users will be able to lock a specific NFT in the contract for the time needed to receive the reward, once that time is up, the user will be able to claim his NFT and also the tokens offered as a reward for staking. If the user wishes to withdraw from the campaign before the time for the reward is up, his NFT will be returned.

> As an administrator, you can create a campaign in which you can set
> the start date, the end date, the time required to block the NFT,
> which NFT you accept for this campaign, maximum number of participants
> and how many tokens the user will receive for participating.

**n1tokentonft:** In this version users will be able to block tokens of any type in the contract for the time necessary to receive the reward, once this time is over, the user will be able to claim his tokens and will receive the NFT offered as a staking reward. If the user wishes to withdraw from the campaign before the time for the reward is up, his tokens will be returned.

> As an administrator, you can create a campaign in which you can set

> whether you want to return the tokens to the participant or take them
